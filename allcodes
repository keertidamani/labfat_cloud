1.	CLOUDTRAIL:
Step 1: Create a Trail
Open the AWS Management Console → CloudTrail → Trails → Create trail.
Enter the trail name “MySecurityTrail” and apply it to all regions. 
Disable Log file SSE KMS encryption

Step 2: Configure Storage
Choose Create a new S3 bucket to store CloudTrail logs.
Use the default settings or the suggested bucket name.
Enable Log file validation and CloudWatch Logs integration for real-time monitoring.

Next page
Step 3: Enable Event Logging
Enable Management events and select both Read and Write.
Click Next, review your configuration, and then click Create trail.
Your trail will now begin logging activities.

Step 4: Generate Some Activity
Perform a few simple AWS operations, such as:
•	Launch or stop a t2.micro EC2 instance.
•	Create or delete an S3 bucket.
These actions will generate API logs recorded by CloudTrail.

Step 5: View and Analyze Events
Go to CloudTrail → Event history after a few minutes.
You’ll see logs of your recent activities.
Open any event to check:
•	Who performed the action (IAM user or role)
•	When it happened (timestamp)
•	Source IP address
•	Resource affected

Step 6: Record Results
Take a screenshot of the Event history showing recent events. Then click on createKeyPair- Open one event and copy the JSON event record into your report.
Highlight details like eventName, userIdentity, sourceIPAddress, and eventTime.

Step 7: Conclusion
AWS CloudTrail continuously logs all API actions in your account.
It helps track who did what, when, and from where, making it crucial for auditing, incident investigation, and security monitoring.
AWS CloudTrail is a monitoring and auditing service that records every API call and activity made within an AWS account. It tracks important details such as the identity of the user or role making the request, the time of the action, the source IP address, and the resources affected.
This detailed logging helps with auditing by providing a chronological record of all operations performed across AWS services, allowing administrators to verify compliance, monitor changes, and ensure accountability.
In terms of incident investigation, CloudTrail is invaluable during security analysis or troubleshooting. It enables security teams to trace unauthorized or suspicious actions, identify who made the change, and understand the context of the event. By reviewing CloudTrail logs, investigators can quickly pinpoint the root cause of incidents, mitigate risks, and strengthen security controls.



2.	CLOUDWATCH:
Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance
Start by launching a t2.micro EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2. This instance will be the resource monitored through CloudWatch. 

NAME : cw-agent-lab; amazo, t3, keypair generate
Go to advanced details: create IAM instance profile (create role ->aws service-> usecase:ec2-> search for CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy and select it-> Name it CloudWatchAgentRole-> create role-> go back to ec2 and select it in iam instance profile

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json -s


Step 2: Install and Configure the CloudWatch Agent
Install and set up the CloudWatch Agent to collect detailed system metrics. This agent allows CloudWatch to gather more information beyond default metrics, such as memory and disk performance data, for deeper visibility.

Go to cloudwatch->all metrics->browse->ec2->per instance metrics->search for cw-agent-lab and take ss of graphs

Step 3: Select Metrics to Monitor -NA
During the setup process, choose key parameters to monitor for performance evaluation:
•	CPU Utilization – Measures the instance’s processor load.
•	Memory Usage – Tracks memory consumption.
•	Disk I/O – Monitors input/output activity on attached storage.
These metrics help understand how efficiently the instance is operating.

Step 4: Start the CloudWatch Agent - NA
Activate the agent so it begins transmitting the selected metrics to the CloudWatch console. Once running, it continuously sends performance data that can be viewed and analyzed in real time.

Step 5: Verify Metrics in CloudWatch Console -NA
Go to the AWS Console → CloudWatch → Metrics → EC2 and check that the data is being displayed correctly. You should see live graphs showing CPU, memory, and disk activity from your instance.

Step 6: Create a CloudWatch Alarm
CHOOSE ALL ALARMS OPTION->  create alarm
Select metric
•	click “Select metric”
•	choose EC2 → Per-Instance Metrics
•	click your instance → check CPUUtilization
•	click Select metric
then change period to 1 min; conditions GREATER than 70
Additional configurations-> 2 out of 2
Configure actions-> In alarm-> create new topic->enter name and gmail->next->name the alarm to HighCPU-Usage-alarm->next->create->click on it and take ss of the graph

Set up an alarm to automatically alert you when the CPU usage is too high.
•	Metric: CPUUtilization
•	Condition: Greater than 70% for 2 consecutive periods
•	Notification: Use an SNS topic to send an email alert.
This ensures timely awareness of performance spikes or abnormal behavior.

Finally, take ss of the gmail

3.	ELASTIC BEANSTALK
Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console, search for Elastic Beanstalk, and click Create application.
Step 2: Enter an Application name (for example: shoelab). Leave defaults for other fields.
Step 3: Under Environment tier, choose Web server environment.
Step 4: Under Platform, choose Python. Then select the latest Python 3.x on 64-bit Amazon Linux 2 branch.
Step 5: Under Application code, choose Upload your code. Upload the prepared ZIP file shoestore_flask_flat_full.zip and type a Version label (for example: v1).
Step 6: Click Next. On the Service access page, click Create role for both Service role and EC2 instance profile. Once they are created, select them from the dropdowns.
Step 7: Click Next through Networking, Database, and Tags. Do not change anything (leave defaults).
Step 8: Click Next through Instance traffic, scaling, monitoring, and logging. Leave all settings as default (single instance, free tier eligible).
Step 9: On the Review page, check your settings and then click Create environment. AWS will now create the environment, EC2 instance, and load balancer. This takes several minutes.
Step 10: When the environment status shows Health: Green, copy and open the environment URL shown at the top (it looks like http://something.elasticbeanstalk.com). This loads your Flask shoe store.
Step 11: In your environment, go to Configuration → Software → Edit. Under Environment properties, add a new variable:
•	Key: SECRET_KEY
•	Value: any long random string (for Flask sessions).
Click Apply. The app restarts automatically.
Step 12: Verify the deployment by visiting:
•	/products → product catalog loads.
•	/cart → add and view items.
•	/checkout → test the demo order form.
•	/health → returns {"ok": true}.
Step 13: After testing, clean up to avoid charges. In Elastic Beanstalk, open your environment → Actions → Terminate environment. Confirm by typing the environment name.

Beanstalk->create application->web server environment-> fill application name and env ->node.js->upload your code ->local file->use domain to print

6.	LAB 4:
A company wants to deploy a secure, scalable, and highly available web application on AWS for global users. Perform the following tasks in AWS and submit screenshots of each step as evidence:
(i) Launch multiple EC2 instances (web servers) and configure them in different Availability Zones.
(ii) Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across these instances.
(iii) Configure health checks so that faulty instances are automatically removed from load balancing.
(iv) Enable Auto Scaling to add/remove instances based on traffic demand.
(v) Configure path-based routing: /auth requests go to the authentication service, /order requests go to the order processing service. Integrate the Load Balancer with Route 53 so that global users are routed to the nearest AWS region.

1️⃣ Launch EC2 Instances in Multiple Availability Zones
→ Go to AWS Management Console → EC2 → Launch Instance
→ Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI (or preferred OS)
→ Select Instance Type → e.g., t2.micro (Free Tier)
→ In Network Settings, choose:
•	VPC → your default or custom VPC
•	Subnet → choose different subnets for each instance (each in a different Availability Zone for high availability)
→ Under Security Group, create or select one named web-server-sg
Inbound security group:
ssh-> source type: my IP
 http-> anywhere
•	Advanced details:
USER DATA CODE:
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
Launch the first instance instance. Repeat the same with a new key-pair
________________________________________
2️⃣ Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
→ Go to EC2 → Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer
→ Choose Application Load Balancer
→ Select Scheme: internet-facing
→ Select VPC and Subnets used by your EC2 instances
→ Create a new Security Group alb-sg with a description: Allows SSH access to developers
ADD INBOUND RULES:
•	Allow inbound HTTP (80) – source: anywhere ipv4; and HTTPS (443) same from 0.0.0.0/0
Then create the security group. Now go back and select it.

→ Under Listeners, choose:
•	HTTP (port 80) → Forward to a new Target Group. Create new target group: target type-instances, give name my-app-target, then next. Now select both instances -> include as pending below->next->create target group. Now go back and add it 
→ Click Create Load Balancer
ITLL WORK NOWW!!!!!!!!
Hello from ip-172-31-36-67.eu-north-1.compute.internal
NOW WE CAN GO TO STEP 4, LEAVE 3 
________________________________________
3️⃣ Configure Health Checks
→ Go to Target Groups → Create Target Group
→ Type → Instances
→ Define a Health Check Path → e.g., /index.html
→ Set:
•	Healthy threshold: 2
•	Unhealthy threshold: 2
→ Register your running EC2 instances with this Target Group
→ Return to the ALB and attach this Target Group as the default target
________________________________________
4️⃣ Enable Auto Scaling
→ Go to EC2 → Launch Templates → Create Launch Template
→ Add:
NAME: my-lb-template
CHECK Provide guidance to help me….
•	AMI (Amazon Linux 2)
•	Instance Type (e.g., t3.micro); select an already created keypairs from the two
•	Security Group → web-server-sg but I did launch-wizard-1
•	Go to advanced details and paste:
•	#!/bin/bash
•	yum update -y
•	yum install -y httpd
•	systemctl start httpd
•	systemctl enable httpd
•	echo "<h1>Hello from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
Now create launch template-> view->ACTIONS-> CREATE AUTO SCALING GROUP
 → Create Auto Scaling Group my-lb-autoscalegrp
→ Choose your Launch Template my-lb-da; SELECT VERSION AS LATEST->next
→ Select the same VPC(already chosen) and subnets used earlier
→ Attach the ASG to your ALB Target Group ie select Attach to an existing load balancer-> select my-app-target
Now turn on elastiv load balancing heal checks in health checks->next

→ Define:
•	Minimum: 1
•	Desired: 2
•	Maximum: 4
→ Add Target tracking Scaling Policy → Target Tracking → choose metric like Average CPU Utilization = 50%->next
→ Review and Create Auto Scaling Group
________________________________________
5️⃣ Configure Path-Based Routing
→ Go to EC2 → Load Balancers → Select your load balancer (click on mylb) → Listeners tab
→ Choose your HTTP:80 listener → Manage rules-> add rules 
In CONDITIONS->add conditions:path:
Path condition value: /auth* then choose target group below (in forward to target groups) -> next-> priority: 10-> next->add rule
Do again for:
Path condition value: /order* then choose target group below (in forward to target groups) -> next-> priority: 20-> next->add rule

Optional/right way-
→ Create Two Target Groups:
•	auth-service-tg → For authentication service
•	order-service-tg → For order processing service
→ Add Listener Rules:
•	If path is /auth* → Forward to auth-service-tg
•	If path is /order* → Forward to order-service-tg
→ Save the rules and test by accessing your ALB DNS with the specific paths.
________________________________________
6️⃣ Integrate with Route 53 for Global Routing
→ Prerequisite: Deploy your full setup (EC2, ALB, ASG) in at least two AWS regions (e.g., N. Virginia & Singapore).
→ Go to Route 53 →Create  Hosted Zones → Select your domain kikiweb.com -> create hosted zone
→ Click Create Record ->  subdomain: app
→ Alias check on -> choose endpoint: alias to application and classic load balancer, choose region as own current and routing policy region also the same current; record id: stocklolm load balancer-> create reciords
Now create another record exactly same except routing region is a new one and record id: hyd load balancer -> create records
NOW IP IS CHANGING AFTER REFRESHING!!!!

1. open s3-> create bucket, bucket name: test-bucket, leave public access blocked and versioning disabled -> create bucket
2. open a new tab of aws
3. aws lambda-> create a function. function name: mytestfunc, runtime: python 3.13
4. CHANGE DEFAULT EXECUTION ROLE: create a new role from aws policy templates, write role name: myTestFunctionRole. Policy Templates: select Amazon S3 object read-only permissions-> create function 
5. Go to code-> code source -> edit the lambda_function.py and write the below code: 
import json
import urllib.parse
import boto3

print('Loading function')

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Uncomment for debugging:
    # print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))
    
    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    key = urllib.parse.unquote_plus(event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key'], encoding='utf-8')
    
    try:
        response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
        print("CONTENT TYPE: " + response['ContentType'])
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'ContentType': response['ContentType']
        }
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        print(f'Error getting object {key} from bucket {bucket}. '
              'Make sure they exist and your bucket is in the same region as this function.')
        raise e
then click on deploy

6. + add trigger (upar) : select a source- s3; select bucket: test-bucket -> i acknowledge-> add
7. go back to test-bucket-> PROPERTIES: event notifications ss take 
8. go back to lambda page and open triggers tab below in configuration - take ss
9. come back to test-bucket page and select upload option-> add files -> upload a png file-> upload 
10. now go to lambda page and check monitor tab->take ss of graphs-> view cloud watch logs-> click on log streams blue link below and take ss of log streams
